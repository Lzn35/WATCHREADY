SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key-here
APP_CONFIG=ProductionConfig
DEBUG=False
```

### 3. Email Configuration (Optional)
If you want email notifications, add these to Railway:
```
MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USE_TLS=True
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### 1. Connect to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select the `WATCH` repository

### 2. Configure Environment
1. Go to your project's "Variables" tab
2. Add the environment variables from `railway.env.example`
3. **IMPORTANT**: Generate a strong `SECRET_KEY`

### 3. Deploy
1. Railway will automatically detect the `Procfile`
2. It will run `python init_database.py` on first deploy
3. Your app will be available at the provided Railway URL

## üîê **POST-DEPLOYMENT SECURITY**

### 1. Change Default Password
- Login with: `discipline_officer` / `admin123`
- **IMMEDIATELY** change the admin password
- Create additional users as needed

### 2. Configure Email (Optional)
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Email Configuration
- Set up SMTP for appointment notifications

## üìä **MONITORING**

### Health Checks
- Railway provides automatic health checks
- App responds to `/` endpoint
- Database connection is tested on startup

### Logs
- View logs in Railway dashboard
- Monitor for any errors or issues

## üéØ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### After Deployment
1. **Database**: Automatically initialized with default users
2. **Admin Access**: `discipline_officer` / `admin123`
3. **Committee Access**: Create via admin panel
4. **Notifications**: Real-time updates every 3 seconds
5. **Email**: Configured if SMTP variables set

### Default Users
- **Discipline Officer**: `discipline_officer` / `admin123`

4. **Port**: Railway handles port configuration automatically

### Support
